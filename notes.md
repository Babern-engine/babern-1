print function is slow dont use it whenever you can except when you are debugging, use it carefully
you dont need threading if what you run are non forever run(while, repeated funtion) function except there is so many of that(more than 3), thread are useful but u can use alternative such as multiproccessing, or asynchronous programming
for audio library is seperated from graphics rendering, so audio library doesn't care about rendering but it just care about playing audio
